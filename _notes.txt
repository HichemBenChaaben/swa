<strong>Table 1.3. Middle-fifth household income, minus selected key sources, 1979–2007. </strong>Underlying data for income, transfers, and pensions are from the Congressional Budget Office Web resource, <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>, “Sources of Income for All Households, by Household Income Category, 1979 to 2007” [Excel spreadsheet] and unpublished data related to the resource. Underlying data for health care deflation are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics <em>Consumer Price Indexes </em>database. Underlying data for hours worked are from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement microdata; see Appendix A for details on microdata. Income data are deflated using a health care deflator, and then the contributions of additional transfers, hours worked, and pensions since 1979 are taken out in sequence. Note that the unpublished CBO data are unrounded, and produce slightly different income dollar values and thus an income growth rate for the middle fifth (19.1 percent) that differs by .1 percentage point from the income growth rate from the rounded, publicly available CBO data underlying Figure 1I. Note that the “hours worked” increases in some periods because total earnings in the CBO data dropped <em>more </em>than hourly earnings in the CPS data (which is where the hourly earnings are measured from) over this period. This implies that hours dropped more than hourly earnings over this period in the CBO data. In other words, if you remove the effect of hours (i.e., leave only the effect of hourly earnings), total earnings will rise.

<strong>Figure 1E. Change in real family income of the middle fifth, actual and predicted, 2000–2018. </strong>Underlying data are from the Current Population Survey public data series on unemployment and from CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement <em>Historical Income Tables</em>, Table F-2, “Share of Aggregate Income Received by Each Fifth and Top 5 Percent of All Families, All Races: 1947– 2010”; Table F-3, “Mean Income Received by Each Fifth and Top 5 Percent of Families, All Races: 1966 to 2010”; and Table F-5, “Race and Hispanic Origin of Householder—Families by Median and Mean Income.” Real family income is indexed such that 2000=100. The projections are based on a regression analysis, based roughly on Katz and Krueger (1999), that uses the annual change in inflation-adjusted income of families in the middle fifth of the money income distribution as the dependent variable and the level of unemployment as the independent variable. The projections then use the regression parameters to forecast annual changes in middle-fifth family income based on unemployment forecasts through 2018 that are made by the Congressional Budget Office and Moody’s Economy.com, a division of Moody’s Analytics.

<strong>Figure 1F. Cumulative change in total economy productivity and real hourly compensation of selected groups of workers, 1995–2011.</strong> Productivity data, which measure output per hour of the total economy, including private and public sectors, are from an unpublished series available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Labor Productivity and Costs program on request. Wage measures are the annual data used to construct tables in Chapter 4: median hourly wages (at the 50th percentile) from Table 4.4 and hourly wages by education from Table 4.14. These are converted to hourly compensation by scaling by the real compensation/wage ratio from the Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) data used in Table 4.2.

<strong>Figure 1G. Share of total household income growth attributable to various income groups, 1979–2007. </strong>Underlying data are from the Congressional Budget Office <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>, “Sources of Income for All Households, by Household Income Category, 1979 to 2007” [Excel spreadsheet]. Each group’s contribution to overall income growth is calculated by multiplying the change in its average income from 1979 to 2007 by its share of the distribution (where, for example, the share of the distribution for the top 1 percent is .01), and dividing the result by the change in overall average income growth over the same time period. For pretax income calculations of the 90th–&lt;95th percentile and 95th–99th percentile, see Figure 2M notes.

<strong>Figure 1I. Change in real annual household income, by income group, 1979–2007. </strong>Underlying data are from the Congressional Budget Office, <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>, “Sources of Income for All Households, by Household Income Category, 1979 to 2007” [Excel spreadsheet]. Cumulative growth is calculated by dividing the average pretax income in the base year (1979) into average pretax income in each subsequent year (1980–2007). The data provide average pretax income for the bottom, second, middle, fourth, and top fifths, and for the top 10, 5, and 1 percent. For the 80th–&lt;90th percentile, average pretax income is calculated by subtracting the aggregate income of the top 10 percent from aggregate income of the top fifth and dividing by the total number of households in the 80th–&lt;90th percentile. Aggregate income is calculated by multiplying the number of households in each income group by average pretax income. The number of households is calculated by subtracting the number of households in the top 10 percent from the number of households in the top fifth. This same procedure is done between the top 10 percent and top 5 percent to calculate average pretax income for the 90th–&lt;95th percentile and between the top 5 percent and top 1 percent to calculate the average pretax income for the 95th–&lt;99th percentile. Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS and then indexed to 1979=0. Note that this publicly available CBO dataset is rounded, and produces slightly different income dollar values and thus an income growth rate for the middle fifth (19.2 percent) that differs by .1 percentage point from the income growth rate from the unpublished, unrounded CBO data underlying Table 1.3.

Data for the middle fifth are shown as is and when applying the cumulative growth rate of the average income for all households.

<strong>Figure 1L. Cumulative change in real annual wages, by wage group, 1979–2010. </strong>Data taken from Kopczuk, Saez, and Song (2010), Table A-3. Data for 2006 through 2010 are extrapolated from 2004 data using changes in wage shares computed from Social Security Administration wage statistics (data for 2010 are at http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi). The final results of the paper by Kopczuk, Saez, and Song printed in a journal used a more restrictive definition of wages so we employ the original definition, as recommended in private correspondence with Kopczuk. SSA provides data on share of total wages and employment in annual wage brackets such as for those earning between $95,000.00 and $99,999.99. We employ the midpoint of the bracket to compute total wage income in each bracket and sum all brackets. Our estimate of total wage income using this method replicates the total wage income presented by SSA with a difference of less than 0.1 percent. We used interpolation to derive cutoffs building from the bottom up to obtain the 0–90th percentile bracket and then estimate the remaining categories. This allows us to estimate the wage shares for upper wage groups. We use these wage shares computed for 2004 and later years to extend the Kopczuk, Saez, and Song series by adding the changes in share between 2004 and the relevant year to their series. To obtain absolute wage trends we used the SSA data on the total wage pool and employment and computed the real wage per worker (based on their share of wages and employment) in the different groups in 2011 dollars.

<strong>Figure 1M. Intergenerational correlations between the earnings of fathers and sons in OECD countries.</strong> The figure is adapted from Corak (2011), Figure 1, “Comparable Estimates of the Intergenerational Elasticity between Father and Son Earnings for the United States and Twenty Four Other Countries.” “Earnings” refers to wages.

<strong>Figure 1N. Elasticities between parental income and sons’ earnings, 1950–2000.</strong> Data are from Aaronson and Mazumder (2007), Table 1,“Estimates of the IGE Using Census IPUMS Data.” Data reflect annual family income for the parents and annual earnings for the sons.

<strong>Figure 1O. Unemployment rate, by race and ethnicity, 1979–2011.</strong> Underlying data are basic monthly Current Population Survey microdata. As with other CPS microdata analyses presented in the book, race/ethnicity categories are mutually exclusive (i.e., white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race).

<strong>Figure 1P Median wealth by race, 1983–2010. </strong>Underlying data are from the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data prepared in 2012 by Edward Wolff for the Economic Policy Institute. The definition of wealth used in this analysis of the SCF is the same definition of wealth used in the analysis of the SCF conducted by Bricker et al. (2012), except that the Bricker et al. analysis includes vehicle wealth, while this analysis does not.

<strong>Table 2.1. Average family income, by income group, 1947–2010.</strong> Underlying data are from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement <em>Historical Income Tables</em>, Table F-2, “Share of Aggregate Income Received by Each Fifth and Top 5 Percent of All Families, All Races: 1947– 2010,” Table F-3, “Mean Income Received by Each Fifth and Top 5 Percent of Families, All Races: 1947 to 2010,” and Table F-5, “Race and Hispanic Origin of Householder—Families by Median and Mean Income: 1947 to 2010.” The years 1947, 1979, 1989, 2000, and 2007 are highlighted throughout the chapter because they are employment cycle peaks and are similar in nature to business cycle peaks. 1995 represents a midway point between cycles to show the growth or stagnation of the period. 2010 is highlighted because it is the most recent year for which data are available. Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS (Consumer Price Index Research Series Using Current Methods).

<strong>Table 2.2. Average household income, by income group, 1967–2010.</strong> Underlying data are from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement <em>Historical Income Tables</em>, Table H-3, “Mean Income Received by Each Fifth and Top 5 Percent, All Races: 1967 to 2010.” Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS.

<strong>Table 2.3.

<strong>Table 2.4. Sources of pretax comprehensive income, by income group, 2007.</strong> Underlying data are from the Congressional Budget Office, <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group,</em> “Sources of Income for All Households, by Household Income Category, 1979 to 2007” [Excel spreadsheet]. Shares of pretax income, by income source, are given by CBO for the bottom, second, middle, fourth, and top fifth, and the top 10, 5, and 1 percent. Average pretax income is defined as the sum of each income groups’ wages, proprietors’ income, other business income, interest and dividends, capital gains pensions, cash transfers, in-kind income, imputed taxes, and other income. For the purposes of this chapter, capital income is defined as the sum of capital gains, interest and dividends, and other business income categories. Sources of income for the groups are calculated by multiplying the shares of each income source by average pretax income. To calculate average pretax income by source for the 95th–&lt; 99th percentile, the aggregate incomes of the top 5 percent were subtracted from the aggregate incomes of the top 10 percent and divided by the total number of households in the 95th–&lt;99th percentile. Aggregate income is calculated by multiplying the number of households in each income group by average pretax income source. The number of households is calculated by subtracting the number of households in the top 5 percent from the number of households in the top 10 percent. The same calculation is done for the 95th–&lt;99th percentile using the top 5 percent and the top 1 percent. The share of total income categories claimed by each group is calculated by dividing the aggregate income for each income source in each income group by the total aggregate income for all households, minus negative income. Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS.

<strong>Table 2.5. Median family income by race and ethnicity, 1947–2010.</strong> Underlying data are from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement <em>Historical Income Tables</em>, Table F-5, “Race and Hispanic Origin of Householder—Families by Median and Mean Income: 1947–2010.” Unlike with CPS microdata analyses presented in the book, race and ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive (i.e., persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race, and white and black Hispanics are counted in the white and black columns as well as the Hispanic column). Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS.

<strong>Table 2.6. Share of average income growth accounted for by the bottom 95 percent, top 5 percent, and top 1 percent, by dataset and income concept, 1979–2007</strong>

Underlying data are from Piketty and Saez (2012, Table A-6); Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement <em>Historical Income Tables</em>, Table H-3, “Mean Household Income Received by Each Fifth and Top 5 percent;” Congressional Budget Office <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group,</em> “Sources of Income for All Households, by Household Income Category, 1979 to 2007” [Excel spreadsheet]; and Burkhauser, Larrimore, and Simon (2011), Table 4, “Quintile Income Growth by Business Cycle Using Each Income Series.” Each income concept’s contribution to overall income growth is calculated by multiplying the change in its average income from 1979 to 2007 by its share of the distribution (where, for example, the share of the distribution for the top 1 percent is .01), and dividing the result by the change in overall average income growth over the same time period.

<strong>Table 2.7. Effective tax rates for selected federal taxes, by income group, 1979–2007.</strong> Underlying data are from the Congressional Budget Office,<em> Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>, “Average Federal Tax Rates for All Households, by Comprehensive Household Income Quintile, 1979–2007” [Excel spreadsheet]. CBO defines individual income taxes as taxes attributed directly to households paying those taxes; social insurance (payroll) taxes are taxes attributed to households paying those taxes directly or paying them indirectly through their employers. Corporate income taxes are attributed to households according to a household’s share of capital income, and federal excise taxes are attributed to households according to their consumption of the taxed good or service.

<strong>Table 2.8. Tax rate, transfer rate, and tax rate net of transfers, by income group, 1979–2007.</strong> Underlying data are from the Congressional Budget Office <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>, “Average Federal Tax Rates for All Households, by Comprehensive Household Income Quintile, 1979–2007,” “Sources of Income for All Households, by Household Income Category 1979 to 2007” [Excel spreadsheets] and unpublished data related to the same report on the composition of in-kind income, with a breakout for health spending (both government transfers and employer-sponsored insurance benefits). The tax rate is taken directly from the first Excel spreadsheet cited here, while the transfer rate is calculated as the share of cash transfers and Medicare and Medicaid spending in comprehensive income.

<strong>Table 2.9. Educational attainment, by income group, selected years, 1979–2007.</strong> Underlying data are from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement microdata; see Appendix A for details. The data are sorted by household income and placed into the income groupings. Then, an hours-weighted measure of the share of all hours worked by workers with the given educational attainment is constructed for each of the income groupings.

<strong>Table 2.10. Share of market-based personal income, by income type, selected years, 1959–2010.</strong> Underlying data for total capital income, rent, dividends, interest, total labor income, wages and salaries, fringe benefits, and proprietors’ income are from Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts, Table 2.1, “Personal Income and Its Disposition.” Underlying data for realized capital gains come from the Internal Revenue Service, <em>SOI Tax Stat–Individual Time Series Statistical Tables</em>, Historical Table 1, “All Individual Income Tax Returns: Sources of Income and Tax Items, Tax Years 1913–2005,” and Table 1, “Individual Income Tax Returns: Selected Income and Tax Items for Specified Tax Years, 1999–2009.” Rent, dividends, interest, total labor income, wages and salaries, fringe benefits, proprietors’ income, and net capital gains are divided by the total market income (the sum of total capital income, total labor income, and proprietors’ income) for select years.

<strong>Table 2.11. Effect of the shift from labor to capital income on the top 1 percent of households, selected years, 1979–2007.</strong> Underlying data are from the Congressional Budget Office, <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>, “Sources of Income for All Households, by Household Income Category, 1979 to 2007” [Excel spreadsheet]. The counterfactual holds the share of all income accounted for by capital income constant at its 1979 level. By implication, this means that all non-capital income sources rise over that time period (since overall income growth is assumed to remain the same). This extra non-capital income is distributed across income groupings in proportion to their actual income shares over time. Then the counterfactual income level of the top 1 percent is calculated and compared with actual trends. Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS.

<strong>Table 2.12. Corporate sector income shares, profit rates, and capital-to-output ratio, selected years, 1959–2010.</strong> Underlying data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts, Table 1.14, “Gross Value Added of Domestic Corporate Businesses in Current Dollars and Gross Value added of Nonfinancial Domestic Corporate Business in Current and Chained Dollars” and BEA Fixed Assets Accounts, Table 6.1, “Current-Cost Net Stock of Private Fixed Assets by Industry Group and Legal Form of Organization.” Total income shares are the sum of labor and capital income, specifically the sum of line items Compensation and Net Operating Surplus to get net value added in NIPA Table 1.14. Labor share is the share of compensation in net value added and capital is net operating surplus over net value added. Pretax profit rate is the net operating surplus divided by private fixed corporate assets, line item 2 from Table 6.1. Post-tax profit rate is the net operating surplus, without taxes, divided by private fixed corporate assets. The capital-to-output ratio is private fixed corporate assets divided by the constructed net value added.

<strong>Table 2.13. Change in sources of comprehensive income, middle fifth of households, selected years, 1979–2007 (2011 dollars).</strong> Underlying data are from the Congressional Budget Office,<em> Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>, “Sources of Income for All Households, by Household Income Category, 1979 to 2007” [Excel spreadsheet], as well as unpublished data related to the same CBO Web resource on the composition of in-kind income, with a breakout for health spending (both government transfers and employer-sponsored insurance benefits). “Imputed taxes” are taxes that are not directly paid by households to government (such as the employer’s share of the payroll tax), but which are “paid” in the form of lower wages and thus are added by the CBO to actual, observed wages to produce the measure of “pretax” income. “Other income” in the pensions category includes withdrawals from 401 (k) plans and traditional pensions and a small category of “other income” that CBO links with pension income in its reports. Note that the unpublished CBO data are unrounded, and produce slightly different income dollar values than the publicly available CBO dataset underlying Figures 2M and 2Z. For deflation of health care benefits (both transfers and employer-provided) we use the Consumer Price Index for medical care (CPI-MC) instead of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers, Research Series (CPI-U-RS) that is used throughout the book.

<strong>Table 2.14. Change in sources of comprehensive income for elderly households in the middle fifth, selected years, 1979–2007.</strong> Underlying data are unpublished data on income source by family type from the Congressional Budget Office related to its 2010 Web resource, <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>. “Imputed taxes” are taxes that are not directly paid by households to government (such as the employer’s share of the payroll tax), but which are “paid” in the form of lower wages and thus are added by the CBO to actual, observed wages to produce the measure of “pretax” income. “Other income” in the pensions category includes withdrawals from 401 (k) plans and traditional pensions, and a small category of “other income” that CBO links with pension income in its reports. The income levels for “Wages and imputed taxes” column and the “Pensions and other income” columns are calculated by the sum of the product of the shares of wages and imputed taxes multiplied by average pre-tax income for each income group and the sum of the product of the share of pensions and other income multiplied by average pretax income. The contribution to shares from income sources is calculated by multiplying the change in the types of income sources by the changes in the total income for elderly households. Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS.

<strong>Table 2.15. Change in sources of comprehensive income for non-elderly households in the middle fifth, selected years, 1979–2007. </strong>Underlying data are unpublished data on income source by family type from the Congressional Budget Office related to its 2010 Web resource, <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>. “Imputed taxes” are taxes that are not directly paid by households to government (such as the employer’s share of the payroll tax), but which are “paid” in the form of lower wages and thus are added by the CBO to actual, observed wages to produce the measure of “pretax” income. “Other income” in the pensions category includes withdrawals from 401 (k) plans and traditional pensions, and a small category of “other income” that CBO links with pension income in its reports. The income levels for “Wages and imputed taxes” column and the “Pensions and other income” columns are calculated by the sum of the product of the shares of wages and imputed taxes multiplied by average pretax income for each income group and the sum of the product of the share of pensions and other income multiplied by average pretax income. The contribution to shares from income sources is calculated by multiplying the change in the types of income sources by the changes in the total income for non-elderly households. Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS. Note that the unpublished CBO data are unrounded, and produce slightly different income dollar values than the publicly available CBO dataset underlying Figures 2M and 2Z.

Contribution of hours versus hourly wages to annual wage growth for working-age households, by income group, selected years, 1979–2007.</strong> Underlying data are from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement microdata; see Appendix A for details. Households are ranked in the same way as in the Congressional Budget Office data—by household income divided by the square root of household size. Average annual wages and annual hours worked for each income group are then calculated, and a household average for hourly wages is calculated by dividing annual wages by annual hours. Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS.

Impact of increasing education and experience on hourly wages of individuals in the middle fifth of the income distribution, selected years, 1979–2007.</strong> Underlying data are from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement microdata; see Appendix A for details. Households are ranked in the same way as in the Congressional Budget Office data—by household income divided by the square root of household size. Fifty age/experience “cells” are created (five educational categories by 10 potential experience categories). Average hourly earnings are calculated for each cell. To get the counterfactual wage growth that would have happened <em>without</em> education and experience upgrading, we hold the 1979 cell weights (i.e., the shares of total hours worked in each year by a given cell) constant, but allow the within-cell wage growth to occur. Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS.

Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS. The projections are based on a regression analysis, based roughly on Katz and Krueger (1999), that uses the annual change in inflation-adjusted income of families in the middle fifth of the money income distribution as the dependent variable and the level of unemployment as the independent variable. The projections then use the regression parameters to forecast annual changes in middle-fifth family income based on unemployment forecasts through 2018 that are made by the Congressional Budget Office and Moody’s Economy.com, a division of Moody’s Analytics.

<strong>Figure 2M. Change in real annual household income, by income group, 1979–2007.</strong> Underlying data are from the Congressional Budget Office, <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>, “Sources of Income for All Households, by Household Income Category, 1979 to 2007” [Excel spreadsheet]. Cumulative growth is calculated by dividing the average pretax income in the base year (1979) into average pretax income in each subsequent year (1980–2007). The data provide average pretax income for the bottom, second, middle, fourth, and top fifths, and for the top 10, 5, and 1 percents. For the 80th–&lt;90th percentile, average pretax income is calculated by subtracting the aggregate income of the top 10 percent from aggregate income of the top fifth and dividing by the total number of households in the 80th–&lt;90th percentile. Aggregate income is calculated by multiplying the number of households in each income group by average pretax income. The number of households is calculated by subtracting the number of households in the top 10 percent from the number of households in the top fifth. This same procedure is done between the top 10 percent and top 5 percent to calculate average pretax income for the 90th–&lt;95th percentile and between the top 5 percent and top 1 percent to calculate the average pretax income for the 95th–&lt;99th percentile. Note that this publicly available CBO dataset is rounded, and produces slightly different income dollar values than the unpublished, unrounded CBO data underlying tables 2.13 and 2.16. Data are inflated to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U-RS, and then indexed to 1979=0.

Cumulative growth is calculated by dividing the average wages in the base year (1979) into average wages in each subsequent year (1980–2007). Average wages by income group are calculated by multiplying the share of wages by the average pretax income in each income group.

<strong>Table 4.1. Average wages and work hours, 1967–2010.</strong>Productivity data, which measure output per hour of the total economy, including the private and public sectors, are from an unpublished series available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Labor Productivity and Costs program on request. The wage-level data are based on the authors’ tabulations of Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC, also known as the March CPS) microdata files using a series on annual, weekly, and hourly wages for wage and salary workers. See Appendix B for the sample definition and other information. The weekly and hourly wage data are “hour weighted,” obtained by dividing annual wages by weeks worked and annual hours worked. The 1967 and 1973 values are derived from unpublished tabulations provided by Kevin Murphy from an update of Murphy and Welch (1989); they include self-employment as well as wage and salary workers. The values displayed in this table were bridged from CPS 1979 values using the growth rates in the Murphy and Welch series. Hours of work were derived from differences between annual, weekly, and hourly wage trends.

<strong>Table 4.2. Average hourly pay and pay inequality, 1948–2011.</strong>The data in the top panel are computed from the Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables. “Wages and salaries” are calculated by dividing wage and salary accruals (NIPA Table 6.3) by hours worked by full-time and part-time employees (NIPA Table 6.9). “Total compensation” is the sum of wages and salaries and benefits (it includes payroll taxes and health, pension, and other nonwage benefits). Payroll taxes are calculated as total compensation (NIPA Table 6.2) minus the sum of volunteer benefits (sum of health and nonhealth benefits; see NIPA Table 6.11) and wages and salaries. “Benefits” is the difference between total compensation and wages and salaries. These data were deflated using the NIPA personal consumption expenditure (PCE, chain-weighted) index, with health insurance adjusted by the PCE medical care (chained) index. These data include both public- and private-sector workers.

The data in the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) panel come from the BLS National Compensation Survey’s employment cost trends and benefits data and provide cost levels for March for private-sector workers, available starting in 1987. We categorize wages and salaries differently than BLS, putting all wage-related items (including paid leave and supplemental pay) into the hourly wage/salary column. This makes the definition of wages and salaries comparable to workers’ W-2 earnings and to the definition of wages in the CPS Outgoing Rotation Group (ORG) data that are tabulated for other tables in this chapter. Benefits, in our definition, include only payroll taxes, pensions, insurance, and “other” benefits. The sum of wages and salaries and benefits makes up total compensation. It is important to use the ECEC (the current-weighted series) rather than the other series from the same National Compensation Survey (NCS) data, the ECI (the fixed-weighted series), because composition shifts (in the distribution of employment across occupations and industries) can have large effects over time. Employer costs for insurance are deflated by the medical-care component of the CPI-U-RS (Consumer Price Index Research Series Using Current Methods). All other pay is deflated by the CPI-U-RS for “all items.” Inflation is measured for the first quarter of each year. Wage and compensation inequality measures are drawn from Pierce (2010). Pierce computes these from the NCS microdata, the data used to calculate the ECI and ECEC data.

<strong>Table 4.7. Change in wage groups’ shares of total wages, 1979–2010.</strong> Data are taken from Kopczuk, Saez, and Song (2010), Table A-3. Data for 2006 through 2010 are extrapolated from 2004 data using changes in wage shares computed from Social Security Administration wage statistics (data for 2010 at http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi). The final results of the paper by Kopczuk, Saez, and Song printed in a journal used a more restrictive definition of wages so we employ the original definition, as recommended in private correspondence with Kopczuk. SSA provides data on share of total wages and employment in annual wage brackets such as for those earning between $95,000.00 and $99,999.99. We employ the midpoint of the bracket to compute total wage income in each bracket and sum all brackets. Our estimate of total wage income using this method replicates the total wage income presented by SSA with a difference of less than 0.1 percent. We use interpolation to derive cutoffs building from the bottom up to obtain the 0–90th percentile bracket and then estimate the remaining categories. This allows us to estimate the wage shares for upper wage groups. We use these wage shares computed for 2004 and later years to extend the Kopczuk, Saez, and Song series by adding the changes in share between 2004 and the relevant year to their series. To obtain absolute wage trends we use the SSA data on the total wage pool and employment and compute the real wage per worker (based on their share of wages and employment) in the different groups in 2011 dollars.

Employer-provided health insurance coverage, by demographic and wage group, 1979–2010.</strong> Table is based on tabulations of CPS-ASEC data samples of private wage-and-salary earners ages 18–64 who worked at least 20 hours per week and 26 weeks per year. This sample is chosen to focus on those with regular employment. Coverage is defined as being included in an employer-provided plan for which the employer paid for at least some of the coverage. As with other CPS microdata analyses presented in the book, race/ethnicity categories are mutually exclusive (i.e., white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race).

<strong>Table 4.13. Dimensions of wage inequality, by gender, 1973–2011.</strong> All of the data are based on analyses of the CPS-ORG data described in Appendix B and used in various tables. The measures of “total wage inequality” are natural logs of wage ratios (multiplied by 100) computed from Tables 4.5 and 4.6. The exception is 1979 data for women, which are 1978–1980 averages; we use these to smooth the volatility of the series, especially at the 10th percentile. The “between-group inequalities” are computed from regressions of the log of hourly wages on education categorical variables (advanced, college only, some college, less than high school with high school omitted), experience as a quartic, marital status, race, and region (4). The college/high school and high school/less-than-high-school premiums are simply the coefficient on “college” and “less than high school” (expressed as the advantage of “high school” over “less than high school” wages). The experience differentials are the differences in the value of age (calculated from the coefficients of the quartic specification) evaluated at 25, 35, and 50 years old. “Within-group wage inequality” is measured as the root mean square error from the same log wage regressions used to compute age and education differentials.

<strong>Table 4.14. Hourly wages by education, 1973–2011. </strong>Table is based on tabulations of CPS wage data described in Appendix B. See Appendix B for details on how a consistent measure of education was developed to bridge the change in coding in 1992.

<strong>Table 4.17. Educational attainment of the employed, by gender and nativity, 2011. </strong>Table is based on analysis of CPS wage earners. The data are described in Appendix B. The categories are as follows: “less than high school” is grade 1–12 or no diploma; “high school/GED” is high school graduate diploma or equivalent; “some college” is some college but no degree; “associate degree” is occupational or academic associate degree; “college degree” is a bachelor’s degree; and “advanced degree” is a master’s, professional, or doctoral degree.

<strong>Table 4.18. Hourly wages of entry-level and experienced workers, by gender and education, 1973–2011.</strong> Table is based on analysis of CPS wage data described in Appendix B. Entry-level wages are measured for a seven-year window starting a year after normal graduation, which translates to ages 19–25 for high school graduates and ages 23–29 for college graduates.

<strong>Table 4.20. Contribution of within-group and between-group inequality to total wage inequality, 1973–2011.</strong> Data are from the CPS-ORG sample described in Appendix B. “Overall wage inequality” is measured as the standard deviation of log wages. “Within-group wage inequality” is the mean square error from log wage regressions (the same ones used for Table 4.13). “Between-group wage inequality” is the difference between the overall and within-group wage inequalities and reflects changes in all of the included variables: education, age, marital status, race, ethnicity, and region.

<strong>Table 4.21. Hourly wage growth by gender and race/ethnicity, 1989–2011.</strong> Table is based on analysis of CPS wage data described in Appendix B. As with other CPS microdata analyses presented in the book, race/ethnicity categories are mutually exclusive (i.e., white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race).

<strong>Table 4.22. Gender wage gap, 1973–2011.</strong> Wages and ratios are based on 50th-percentile wages from Tables 4.5 and 4.6 (CPS-ORG data).

<strong>Table 4.23. Factors contributing to the productivity/compensation gap, 1973–2011. </strong>Table is based on analysis of Mishel and Gee (2012), Table 1. Mishel and Gee present a decomposition of the gap between productivity and median hourly compensation. This has been reconfigured to eliminate the gap between median hourly wages and compensation so the decomposition is between productivity and median hourly compensation.

<strong>Table 4.24. Impact of rising and falling unemployment on wage levels and gaps, 1979–2011. </strong>Table is based on analyses of yearly wage decile data from Tables 4.5 and 4.6 (see Appendix B), and of unemployment data using model from Katz and Krueger (1999). The unemployment rate is from the Current Population Survey. The simulated effect of change of unemployment presented in the table was calculated by regressing the log-change of nominal wages on the lagged log-change of the CPI-U-RS (but, following Katz and Krueger [1999], the coefficient is constrained to equal 1), the unemployment rate, lagged productivity growth, and dummies for various periods (1989–1995, 1996–2000, 2001–2007). Using these models, wages were predicted for the periods in the table given a simulated unemployment rate series in which unemployment remains fixed at its starting-year level. So in the 1979 to 1985 period, unemployment was fixed at its 1979 level and not allowed to rise (as actually happened) throughout the period. The “estimated cumulative impact of unemployment” shows the difference between actual wages and the wages when unemployment was held fixed in the starting year.

<strong>Table 4.25. Annual pay in expanding and contracting industries, 1979–2007.</strong> These data reflect the average (annual) wages, benefits, and compensation of the net new employment in each period based on changes in industry composition. The employment data are payroll counts from the BLS Current Employment Statistics, and the pay data are from 2008 Bureau of Economic Analysis NIPA tables (calculated per payroll employee). The pay of the net new employment is a weighted average of the pay by industry in which the weights are the changes in each industry’s employment share over the period.

<strong>Table 4.26. Employer health care costs as a share of wages, 1948–2010.</strong> Table is based on analysis of National Income and Product Accounts data. Wage data are from NIPA Table 6.3, and group health insurance data are from NIPA Tables 6.11A-C, and 6.11D.

<strong>Table 4.27. Employer health care costs as a share of wages, by wage fifth, 1996–2008. </strong>Table is based on analysis of Burtless and Milusheva (2012) based on Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The authors provide data by decile which we aggregated to fifths. The premiums include both those enrolled and not enrolled in employer plans. The premiums were estimated by Burtless and Milusheva using various imputation methods.

<strong>Table 4.33. Union wage premium by demographic group, 2011.</strong> “Percent union” is tabulated from CPS-ORG data (see Appendix B) and includes all those covered by unions. “Union premium” values are the coefficients on union in a model of log hourly wages with controls for education, experience as a quartic, marital status, region, industry (12) and occupation (9), race/ethnicity, and gender where appropriate. For this analysis we only use observations that do not have imputed wages because the imputation process does not take union status into account and therefore biases the union premium toward zero. See Mishel and Walters (2003). As with other CPS microdata analyses presented in the book, race/ethnicity categories are mutually exclusive (i.e., white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race).

<strong>Table 4.34. Union premiums for health, retirement, and paid leave benefits.</strong> Table is based on Table 4 in Mishel and Walters (2003), which draws on Buchmueller, DiNardo, and Valletta (2001).

<strong>Table 4.35. Union impact on paid leave, pension, and health benefits.</strong> Table is based on Table 3 in Mishel and Walters (2003), which draws on Pierce (1999), Tables 4, 5, and 6.

<strong>Table 4.36. Effect of union decline on male wage differentials, 1978–2011. </strong>This analysis replicates, updates, and expands on Freeman (1991), Table 2, using the CPS-ORG sample used in other analyses (see Appendix B). The year 1978, rather than 1979, is the earliest year analyzed because we have no union membership data in our 1979 sample. “Percent union” is the share covered by collective bargaining. The “union wage premium” for a group is based on the coefficient on collective bargaining coverage in a regression of hourly wages on a simple human capital model (the same one used for estimating education differentials, as described in note to Table 4.13), with major industry (12) and occupation (9) controls in a sample for that group. The change in union premium across years, therefore, holds industry and occupation composition constant. Freeman’s analysis assumed the union premium was unchanged over time. We allow the union premium to differ across years so changes in the “union effect” on wages (the union wage premium times union coverage) are driven by changes in the unionization rate and the union wage premium. The analysis divides the percentage-point change in the union effect on wage differentials by the actual percentage-point change in wage differentials (regression-adjusted with simple human capital controls plus controls for other education or occupation groups) to determine the deunionization contribution to the change in the wage gaps among men, which, as a negative percent, indicates contribution to the growth of the wage gaps.

<strong>Table 4.37. Union wage premium for subgroups.</strong> The analysis builds on Mishel and Walters (2003), Table 2.3A and Gundersen (2003), Table 5.1 and Appendix C. Premium estimates by fifth are from Schmitt (2008); Card, Lemieux, and Riddle (2002); and Gittleman and Pierce (2007). Union coverage by fifth is from Schmitt (2008).

<strong>Table 4.42. Role of executives and financial sector in income growth of top 1.0% and top 0.1%, 1979–2005. </strong>Table is based on authors’ analysis of Bakija, Cole, and Heim (2012) Tables 4, 5, 6a, and 7a, using tables that include capital-gains income. The Bakija, Cole, and Heim paper tabulates IRS tax returns and exploits the information on the primary and secondary taxpayer occupation data provided there.

<strong>Table 4.43. CEO compensation and CEO-to-worker compensation ratio, 1965–2011. </strong>Complete details on the data used to compute CEO compensation trends and the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio can be found in Mishel and Sabadish (2012), <em>Methodology for Measuring CEO Compensation and the Ratio of CEO-to-Worker Compensation</em> at http://www.epi.org/publication/wp293-ceo-to-worker-pay-methodology. We use executive compensation data from the ExecuComp database of Compustat, a division of Standard &amp; Poor’s. The ExecuComp database contains data on many forms of compensation for the top five executives at publicly traded U.S. companies in the S&amp;P 1500 Index for 1992–2010. We employ two definitions of annual CEO compensation based on different ways of measuring option awards. “Realized direct compensation,” referred to as “Options realized” in the table, is the sum of salary, bonus, restricted stock grants, options exercised, and long-term incentive payouts. It follows the definition of compensation used in previous editions of <em>The State of Working America</em>, which in turn adapted this definition from the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (<em>WSJ</em>) annual report on CEO compensation (compensation reported by the <em>WSJ</em> has been compiled by various companies over the years, including Pearl Meyer, the Mercer Group, and the Hay Group and is the longest CEO pay series available to us). “Total direct compensation” (also a definition used in the <em>WSJ</em> series and labeled “Options granted” in the table) is the sum of salary, bonus, restricted stock grants, options granted (Compustat Black Scholes value), and long-term incentive payouts.

We define a CEO as an executive labeled a CEO by the variable CEOANN. Note that the executive flagged as the CEO may not necessarily be the highest-paid executive at the company. The CEOs included in our series are CEOs at the top 350 firms based on sales each year for 1992–2010.

Because no data for the compensation of an average worker in a firm exist, we create a proxy: the hourly compensation of a “typical” worker in a firm’s key industry. The wage measure is the production/nonsupervisory worker hourly earnings in that industry, the same series used in Table 4.3 for the entire private sector. We obtain compensation by multiplying the compensation wage ratio computed from NIPA Tables 6.3C and 6.3D. The hourly wages of production and nonsupervisory employees in 2011 were $19.47, 21 percent higher than the median hourly wage, so our proxy severely overstates the compensation of a typical worker and understates the CEO-to-worker pay ratio.

We use the growth in CEO compensation in the <em>WSJ</em> series to extend the CEO compensation series and the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio series backward. The <em>WSJ</em> series conducted by Pearl Meyer covered the years 1965, 1968, 1973, 1978, 1989, and 1992. We convert the compensation series to constant dollars using the CPI-U-RS and calculate the ratio of CEO compensation in each year as a fraction of the 1992 CEO compensation level. We then apply these ratios to the CEO compensation for 1992 calculated from the ExecuComp data. This moves the series backward in time so that the growth of CEO pay is the same as in the Pearl Meyer/<em>WSJ</em> series but is benchmarked to the levels in the ExecuComp series.

We make a similar set of computations to obtain a historical series for the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio. We start with the Pearl Meyer/<em>WSJ</em> series in constant dollars and divide it by an estimate of private-sector annual compensation of production/nonsupervisory workers in the same year. The compensation series is the real hourly compensation series presented in Figure 4B multiplied by 2,080 hours.

<strong>Table 4.44. Trends in education wage gaps, key wage group wage gaps, and relative supply of education, 1979–2011.</strong> The gross wage gap data are computed from underlying yearly data with selected years presented in Tables 4.4 and 4.8. The education wage gaps are computed from the same regressions for which results on college/high school and high school/less-than-high-school wage premiums are reported in Table 4.13, regressions of the log of hourly wages on education categorical variables (advanced degree, college only, some college, less than high school with high school omitted), experience as a quartic, marital status, race, and region (4). The college or more/noncollege differential is drawn from a similar regression except there is only one education dummy variable for those with a college degree or advanced degree. This estimate was also used in the analysis of trade’s impact on the college wage gap presented in Table 4.29.

Wage measures are the annual data used to construct tables in this chapter: median hourly wages (at the 50th percentile) from Table 4.4 and hourly wages by education from Table 4.14. These are converted to hourly compensation by scaling by the real compensation/wage ratio from the Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) data used in Table 4.2.

<strong>Figure 4E. Share of workers earning poverty-level wages, by gender, 1973–2011.</strong> Figure is based on analysis of Current Population Survey (CPS) wage data described in Appendix B. The poverty-level wage is calculated using an estimate of the four-person weighted average poverty threshold in 2011 of $23,010 (based on the 2010 threshold updated for inflation). This is divided by 2,080 hours to obtain a poverty-level wage of $11.06 in 2011. The poverty-level wage is roughly equal to two-thirds of the median hourly wage. This figure is deflated by CPI-U-RS (Consumer Price Index Research Series Using Current Methods) to obtain the poverty-level wage levels for other years. The threshold is available at the U.S. Census Bureau website.

The counterfactual 2011 labor force participation rate is what the labor force participation rate would have been in 2011 if the labor force participation rate of each of 30 gender/age/education cells had continued on the same linear trend from 2007 to 2011 that they followed from 1989 to 2007, but if the relative sizes of those cells evolved as they actually did. (Note, there are three age groups: 16–24, 25–54, and 55+; and five education groups: less than high school, high school, some college, college degree, and advanced degree. The table presents aggregated results by gender and age.) The counterfactual 2011 unemployment rate is what the unemployment rate in 2011 would have been if the workers making up the difference between the actual and the counterfactual 2011 labor force participation rate were in the labor force and unemployed instead of out of the labor force.

Note that in international comparisons of income it is standard practice (including at EPI) to convert currencies using “purchasing power parity” (PPP) exchange rates instead of market exchange rates. PPPs are based on the price of buying a given “basket” of goods and services in each country, thereby equalizing the purchasing power of currencies. It should be noted that for these data, market exchange rates, not PPP exchange rates, are used to convert currencies to U.S. dollars. The authors of the report argue that there is a case to be made for using market exchange rates for international comparisons of wealth because in every country a large share of personal wealth is owned by households in the top few percentiles of the distribution, and these households tend to move their assets across borders with relative frequency. Results are not available using PPP exchange rates. It also should be noted that the ratio of mean to median is the same regardless of what exchange rates are used.

<strong>Table 7.3. Impact of changes in U.S. economic and demographic composition on the poverty rate, selected periods, 1979–2010.</strong> Underlying data are from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement microdata; see Appendix A for details. The methodology for this decomposition is taken from Danziger and Gottschalk (1995, Chapter 5), which explores the role of changes in socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., changes in average income, changes in income inequality, and demographic changes such as the change in racial groups’ shares of the overall population) on the poverty rate (using the official poverty rate) between any two years. We focus specifically on the 1979–1989, 1989–2000, 2000–2007, 2007–2010, and 1979–2007 periods. To examine the impact of average income of the U.S. population on the poverty rate, we assign the average real income growth across the period to be the growth for all individuals between years t0 and t1 and simulate a new poverty rate. This procedure holds the shape of the distribution (inequality) constant in t0 while allowing incomes to grow equally for all individuals. This simulated poverty rate for t1 is then compared to the actual poverty rate in year t0, and the percentage-point difference is the change in the mean, i.e. the impact of income growth. The change due to income inequality is the percentage-point difference between the simulated poverty distribution in t1 and the actual poverty rate in t1.

We repeat this exercise using the demographic composition of each variable of interest to see the effect of these demographic changes on the overall poverty rate. First we calculate the weight of each demographic factor (such as individuals with college degrees) by its population share and simulate the poverty rate in t1 for all persons between t0 and t1, allowing for income to grow equally among all families and holding the demographic composition of the population in t0 constant. Then, we calculate a second simulated rate that incorporates both the mean income growth and the demographic changes across the period. The difference between these two simulated rates in t1 is the percentage point-change in the poverty rate due to demographic changes.

The interaction, or error, term states to what degree the demographic variables are conflated, which could lead to bias in measurement of a factor’s impact. Since our error term is negative and relatively small (-.4 from 1979–2007), the reported relationship might slightly overstate the degree to which the simulated income decreases the poverty rate for each demographic group, but it is not enough to change the story.

The link between GDP and poverty in the earlier period (1959–1973) and the potential for GDP to eradicate poverty by the 1980s holds true for alternative specifications including using only the under-age-65 poverty rate (to remove elderly, the main recipients of Social Security, also growing over this period) and controlling for one target demographic: female headed families.

The percentage-point changes in the unemployment rate across the periods shown come from the monthly Current Population Survey public data series, while percentage-point changes in the poverty rate come from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement <em>Historical Poverty Tables</em>, Table 2, “Poverty Status, by Family Relationship, Race, and Hispanic Origin.”

<strong>Figure 7O. Increase in wages from a 1-percentage-point decline in the unemployment rate, by gender. </strong>Estimates use Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group microdata (see Appendix B), and are computed based on a model employed by Katz and Krueger (1999). Annual changes in log wages are regressed on unemployment, lagged log-changes in the CPI-U-RS (but, following Katz and Krueger the coefficient on this is constrained to equal 1), lagged productivity growth, and dummies for 1989–1995, 1996–2000, and 2001–2007 (excluded period is 1979–1988). The sample covers the years 1979–2007.

<strong>Figure 7P. Impact of changes in family structure on the poverty rate, selected periods, 1979–2010. </strong>The figure looks at the overall composition of family structure in the United States (e.g., the share of families headed by a single mother) and measures how much the change in the composition has affected the poverty rate in given periods. For more information on the methodology underlying the figure, see the note to Table 7.3.

<strong>Figure 7T.</strong> <strong>Share of bottom-fifth household income accounted for by wages, cash transfers, and in-kind income, 1979–2007.</strong> Underlying data are from the 2010 Congressional Budget Office, <em>Average Federal Taxes by Income Group</em>, “Sources of Income for all Households, by Household Income Category, 1979–2007” [Excel spreadsheet]. The Congressional Budget Office definition of in-kind income includes employer-paid health insurance premiums, food stamps, school lunches and breakfasts, housing assistance, energy assistance, and the fungible value of Medicare and Medicaid, as estimated by the Current Population Survey. CBO’s definition of cash transfers includes payments from Social Security, unemployment insurance, Supplemental Security Income, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, veterans’ benefits, and workers’ compensation.

<strong>Figure 7U. Earnings at the 10th percentile as a share of median worker earnings in selected OECD countries, late 2000s. </strong>Underlying data are metadata from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s <em>Distribution of Gross Earnings of Full-time Employees and Gender Wage Gap </em>database. Earnings for all countries are defined as gross earnings for full-time, full-year workers, with the exception of Denmark, which is for all workers, the Netherlands, which is for full time, full-year equivalent workers, and Switzerland, which is net earnings for full-time workers. The shares are earnings at the 10th percentile as a share of the median earnings in each country’s respective currency.

<strong>Figure 7V. Earnings at the 10th percentile in selected OECD countries relative to the United States, late 2000s. </strong>Underlying data are metadata from the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development’s <em>Distribution of Gross Earnings of Full-time Employees and Gender Wage Gap </em>database. See note for Figure 7U on definition of earnings. Data for earnings at the 10th percentile are converted into weekly earnings and are then converted into equivalent U.S. dollars using a purchasing power parity index from the International Monetary Fund <em>World Economic Outlook</em> <em>Database</em>. The figure shows the share of each country’s 10th percentile earnings relative to the 10th percentile earnings in the United States.

<strong>Figure 7W. Relative poverty rate in the United States and selected OECD countries, late 2000s. </strong>Underlying data are from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s <em>Stat Extracts</em> public data series. Household-size-adjusted income, or equivalent income, is household income divided by the square root of the household size. Countries were chosen based on their productivity per worker hour using the “PPP Converted GDP Laspeyres Per Hour Worked by Employees at 2005 Constant Prices” series from <em>Penn World Table Version 7.0 </em>(Heston, Summers, and Aten 2011). We chose to exclude countries whose productivity is less than half that of the United States. The OECD data base uses slightly different methods than that found in 7I (e.g., its handling of taxes and transfers are different), therefore, the relative rates for the United States are not exactly the same.

<strong>Figure 7X. Child poverty rate in selected developed countries, 2009. </strong>Underlying data are from UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre Report Card 10 (Adamson 2012)<em>,</em> Figure 1b, “Child Poverty Rate.” The poverty rate is the percentage of children (age 0–17) living in households with equivalent income lower than 50 percent of the national median, where equivalent income is disposable income, adjusted for family size and composition. UNICEF uses a modified equivalence scale to adjust for household size by weighting the first adult in the household by 1, the subsequent adults by .5, and children under age 14 by .3, then summing the weights up and dividing total household income by the total weight. We chose countries based on their productivity per worker hour using the “PPP Converted GDP Laspeyres Per Hour Worked by Employees at 2005 Constant Prices” series from <em>Penn World Table Version 7.0 </em>(Heston, Summers, and Aten 2011) and excluded countries whose productivity is less than half that of the United States.

<strong>Figure 7Y. Child poverty gap in selected developed countries, 2009. </strong>Underlying data are from UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre Report Card 10 (Adamson 2012), Figure 7, “The Poverty Gap.” The child poverty gap is the distance between the poverty line and the median family income of children below the poverty line, expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. This is calculated by lining up all individuals in households by household-size-adjusted income (with children taking their family income value) and then locating the poverty line, which is 50 percent of national median income. UNICEF uses a modified equivalence scale to adjust for household size by weighting the first adult in the household by 1, the subsequent adults by .5, and children under age 14 by .3, then summing the weights up and dividing total household income by the total weight. The median income of children below the poverty line is then calculated. Then the gap between the poverty line and the median income of children is then taken as a share of the poverty line. For example, for a country with a median income of $50,000, the poverty line is $25,000. If the median income for children living below $25,000 is $15,000, the difference is $25,000<strong>-</strong>$15,000 = $10,000. This difference, taken as a share of the poverty line, yields a child poverty gap of $10,000/$25,000 (40 percent). We chose countries from the UNICEF list based on their productivity per worker hour using the “PPP Converted GDP Laspeyres Per Hour Worked by Employees at 2005 Constant Prices” series from <em>Penn World Table Version 7.0 </em>(Heston, Summers, and Aten 2011), and excluded countries whose productivity is less than half that of the United States.

<strong>Figure 7Z. Extent to which taxes and transfer programs reduce the relative poverty rate, selected developed OECD countries, late 2000s.</strong> Underlying data are from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s <em>Stat Extracts </em>public data series. Household-size-adjusted income, or equivalent income, is household income divided by the square root of the household size. We chose countries based on their productivity per worker hour using the “PPP Converted GDP Laspeyres Per Hour Worked by Employees at 2005 Constant Prices” series from <em>Penn World Table Version 7.0 </em>(Heston, Summers, and Aten 2011), and excluded countries whose productivity is less than half that of the United States.

<strong>Figure 7AA. Social expenditure and relative poverty rates selected in OECD countries, late 2000s.</strong> Underlying data are from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s<em> Stat Extracts </em>public data series. The relative poverty rate is the share of individuals living in households with income below half of household-size-adjusted median income, which is household income divided by the square root of the household size. We chose countries based on their productivity per worker hour using the “PPP Converted GDP Laspeyres Per Hour Worked by Employees at 2005 Constant Prices” series from the <em>Penn World Table Version 7.0</em> (Heston, Summers, and Aten 2011), and excluded countries whose productivity is less than half that of the United States.
