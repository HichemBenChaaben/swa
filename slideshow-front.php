				<p>Chart the growth in U.S. household income since 1917—and see how the growth has been shared between the Top 10% and the Bottom 90% of Americans.</p>
<ul>		<li>Between 1948 and 1979 the richest 10% accounted for a third of average income growth – matching their share in 1948 and keeping the income distribution stable for these three decades.</li>
				<li>Between 1979 and 2007 the richest 10% accounted for a full 91% of average income growth.</li>

				<p>A historical context for the damage done and the long aftermath ahead.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Single largest increase in the unemployment rate since 1948</li>
					<li>Unemployment stubbornly high many months into the official recovery</li>
					<li>Median family incomes lower in 2009 than they have been since 1997</li>

				<h4>Economic outcomes began changing radically in the 1970s, but why?</h4>
				<a href="/features/view/3"><img src="img/accordion/economic.png" alt="#"/></a>
				<ul>
					<li>The policy commitment to low unemployment rates was traded for one of low inflation rates</li>
					<li>The U.S. and a much poorer global economy became more tightly integrated</li>
					<li>Key labor market institutions (minimum wage, right to organize unions) have been undermined.</li>

				<h4>Economy already failing most families for decades before Great Recession</h4>

				<p>Stratospheric gains at top pull overall averages up, but leave low- and moderate-income families struggling.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Between 1979 and 2007, the richest 10% of families claimed almost two-thirds of all income growth</li>
					<li>More-equitable growth would have gained median families $9,000 in annual income</li>
					<li>Poverty could have been eradicated by the mid-1980s</li>
